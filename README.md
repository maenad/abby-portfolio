# A bit about me.
Hello! I hope that you are doing great!

My name is Abby and I am a UI/UX with knowledge in web development. 

Currently working with Figma, Adobe XD, Miro and Photoshop. For web layout and styling I like to use SASS (besides the classic HTML/CSS combo), nevertheless I am always open to learn and add new tools to my repertory.
